Create a new Rust source file named `ingresar_img_thumbnails.rs` inside its own separate folder within the project directory. Do not modify or affect any other files or parts of the project. Inside this new file, do not add any code yet; just create the empty file with proper naming and structure.

# Steps

1. Identify the appropriate location for the new folder within the project hierarchy.
2. Create the new folder dedicated to `ingresar_img_thumbnails.rs`.
3. Inside that folder, create an empty Rust source file named `ingresar_img_thumbnails.rs`.
4. Ensure no other files in the project are modified or affected.

# Output Format

Provide a description confirming that the new folder and empty Rust source file have been created without altering any other files.

# Notes

- Do not write any Rust code inside the new file.
- Only create the folder and empty file as requested.
- Preserve the integrity of the existing project structure and files.
